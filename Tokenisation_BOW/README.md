Project: Tokenization in Bag of Words (BOW)
Welcome to the Tokenization project, a detailed exploration of the inner workings of tokenization within the Bag of Words (BOW) framework. In this endeavor, we adopt a manual and deliberately naive approach to comprehensively understand the intricate processes involved in tokenization.

Project Overview:
Objective: Our primary objective is to gain a deep insight into tokenization processes, specifically within the context of the Bag of Words model. This project opts for a bespoke approach, eschewing pre-built modules from libraries, and instead, we leverage custom functions at each step.

Approach: The deliberate decision to utilize custom functions at every stage of the project facilitates a granular understanding of tokenization processes. This methodology serves to demystify the fundamental concepts underlying tokenization in BOW, which represents a foundational technique in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Key Features:
1. Manual and Naive Approach:
Our project deliberately avoids relying on pre-existing libraries, opting instead for a manual and naive approach. This ensures a thorough comprehension of each facet of tokenization, from initial concepts to the final implementation.

2. Custom Functions:
At every stage of the project, we employ custom functions tailored to the unique requirements of tokenization within the BOW model. This hands-on approach provides an unparalleled understanding of the mechanics involved.

3. Fundamental Understanding:
Tokenization in BOW is considered a basic yet crucial aspect of NLP. By delving into its inner workings, we aim to foster a fundamental understanding of the processes that form the backbone of more advanced natural language processing techniques.

Project Significance:
The significance of this project lies in its ability to equip learners with a robust foundation in tokenization, enabling them to comprehend the nuances of BOW and laying the groundwork for more advanced NLP endeavors.

I invite you to explore the intricacies of tokenization within the BOW framework, where each step is meticulously detailed to enhance your understanding of this fundamental NLP concept.

Thank you for joining us on this educational journey.

Best Regards,
